# EVPN Gateway Appliance (EGA) — productization critical path

Baseline checked 2026-09-29 from Jira (CORENET-7400 and its children, PLMPGM-6293, RELENG-503/589/596);
RELENG-596's status rechecked 2026-10-08.
These are the steps that take calendar time from other teams and do not depend on
engineering progress, so they should start first. Dates are the tickets' own; the
plan's owners are proposals. [Decisions](kickoff-decisions.md) lists the inputs to settle,
and [source evidence](source-evidence.md#10-production-identity-precedents) records the
repository-side precedents (KRD `prodsec` test, product-definitions, advisories).

## The template is for operators

BGP Cloud Connector followed PLMPGM-6293, "Productization - Konflux (EPIC) Template": twelve
numbered tasks for an OLM operator, cloned with the Jira UI Clone dialog (not the API, which
loses the child tasks) and dated to GA at about start + 60 days. CORENET-7400 is that clone.
The September 29 survey found no EVPN productization epic; confirm current onboarding with PM.

| Template task | Applies to EGA? |
| --- | --- |
| 01 Operations Readiness Form (branding, export compliance, SKU), 02 Privacy Impact Assessment, 03 ProdSec onboarding and RH-SDL, 08 Eng ID → SKU, 10 QE, 11 docs | Yes, unchanged |
| 04 Jira project | Skip: CORENET exists. Ask for an OCPBUGS component or other bug home for customers |
| 05 Cicada | Partly: the bootc repository fits. Bundle repositories and `fbc_opt_in` do not. Disk downloads and any Hub or AMI channel have no template task ([channels](bib-configuration-spec.md#customer-delivery-channels)) |
| 06 Konflux | Yes, with the [artifact graph](pipeline-spec.md#artifact-graph-and-candidate-integrity) in place of operator, bundle and FBC |
| 07 Multi-version FBC | No. BGP Cloud Connector skipped it too (rolling stream, one ReleasePlan and RPA) |
| 09 Operator lifecycle, 12 GA (OperatorHub, Master Operators List) | Adapt: an appliance needs a lifecycle-page entry and support tier, not OperatorHub visibility |

The other PLMPGM template, for Agentic/Applied AI products, adds AI-specific prerequisites
(model, MCP, guardrails) and does not fit, so ask Program Management how a non-operator
product is onboarded. The operator template's export-compliance task adds an operator to the OCP
EARF document; ask the export team which section covers a bootc appliance and collection.

## Measured path: BGP Cloud Connector

| Step | Dates | Elapsed | Note |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Repository created, Eng ID requested (RELENG-503), RPA merge request opened | Jul 30 | — | The request linked its draft RPA MR; short name recorded as "No short name was approved" |
| Template cloned; Jira project (7401) | Aug 4 | same day | |
| PIA (7406) | Aug 4 → 6 | 2 days | The template quotes 10 business days to get a reviewer and 2–3 weeks or more |
| Eng ID 1209 assigned | Aug 11 | 12 days | Through a merge request to the product-service configuration repository |
| Delivery repositories created as Tech Preview (Cicada) | Aug 12 | | Promoted to GA with the `1.0` content stream Aug 31 |
| Export authorization form submitted | Aug 13 | | The form's request showed no activity by Sep 16, so clearance stayed unconfirmed; ask the export team for an explicit answer before GA |
| First stage advisories; Konflux onboarding closed (7409) | Aug 17–19 | 18–20 days after repository | Tenant, RPAs, ReleasePlans, `prodsec` template (KRD !21378), 14 stage RHBAs by closure |
| Eng ID → SKU mapping requested (7402) | Aug 24 → Sep 17 | 24 days | The owner was told 2–3 weeks; it reached Offering Manager on Sep 28 and did not block GA |
| Product listing merge request | Sep 10 | | Done by direct MR; Cicada was not used |
| ProdSec and RH-SDL (7410, tracked in SSE-7659) | Aug 6 → Sep 17 | 42 days | Assigned to a ProdSec engineer; the CPE request starts here |
| First production advisory (2026:67519) | Sep 15 | 47 days after repository | |
| GA tasks closed (7403); catalog listing linked | Sep 28 | | Lifecycle enablement (PLMCORE-17446) still In Progress; FBC 5.0 builds fail to inject lifecycle data |

Reading the timeline:

- **Konflux work overlapped the approvals.** Stage releases ran from Aug 17 while the
  export form, SKU mapping and SDL were open. This timeline does not prove each
  approval blocked production: SKU mapping trailed GA and export clearance was
  unconfirmed. Obtain EGA's explicit release requirements from the responsible owners.
- **The Operations Readiness task closed after the Eng ID existed** (Sep 28 against Aug 11),
  and RELENG-503 records no name approvals: its marketing, branding/legal and program-manager
  boxes are unchecked, with marketing marked "Not needed for operators". RELENG-589, a
  non-operator product, had all three checked. The internal Engineering ID guide still says
  name approval comes first, and EGA is not an operator, so plan on the full approval set and
  start it first; the precedent shows the ID request need not wait for the form's closure.
- **A draft RPA can carry the request.** RELENG-589 (Sep 15 → 25, 10 days) linked a draft
  RPA MR with placeholder product ID, advisory metadata and Pyxis paths; the reviewer also
  asked whether its proposed short name, already approved by the brand team, collided with an
  existing certification name. Check the proposed short name for collisions before filing.
- **A product without its own SKU still needs an Eng ID** to publish through Pyxis
  (RELENG-596, a bootc product, reopened Sep 28 and Closed as of Oct 8). If EGA rides an
  existing offering, decide that in the [product-home row](kickoff-decisions.md) first;
  it selects whose ID, CPE and stream apply.
- **Late-arriving records are non-blocking only if PM says so.** SKU mapping and lifecycle
  enablement trailed GA for BGP Cloud Connector; record the same call for EGA explicitly.

## How an Engineering ID is created

Checked against the releng SOP for it (internal `konflux/docs/sop`,
[`releng/engineering-id-creation.md`](https://gitlab.cee.redhat.com/konflux/docs/sop/-/blob/f4f0e13/releng/engineering-id-creation.md),
`f4f0e13`). File the request with the RELENG-345 Jira template. Releng will not open the change
until two things are on the ticket: Legal/Branding approval of the product name and short name,
in the exact spelling and capitalization to be used, and Product Management's acknowledgment
that a separate Engineering ID is needed. The second ties to the
[product-home decision](kickoff-decisions.md): a product that rides an existing offering may not
get a separate ID, though publishing through Pyxis still needs one (RELENG-596). The change is a
merge request adding `cloud/<short-name>/<short-name>.yaml` to `product-service-config-auto`, with
the name, the **architectures**, the **environments** (stage, prod) and the customer-portal label.
It has no `id` field: the ID is assigned when the merge pipeline runs, and a release engineer who
owns the directory approves. Architectures and environments are entered at request time.
BGP Cloud Connector entered x86_64 only, yet its first advisory (2026:67519) also lists an arm64
operator image, so ask releng whether the entered architectures must match what ships, and settle
EGA's supported architectures before filing.

## Order of work

1. **PM, now:** official name, short name and brand approval; the Operations Readiness Form;
   the export form, opened at least 30–60 days before the first customer release; the PIA.
2. **Product Security, now:** an assigned engineer, the RH-SDL tracker, the CPE request and a
   product-definitions entry. The KRD `prodsec/<tenant>.yaml` template and every production
   RPA depend on them.
3. **Releng, as the request inputs are ready:** request the Eng ID after name approval,
   PM acknowledgment and architecture/environment choices; tenant creation is not a
   prerequisite in the checked SOP. A draft RPA may accompany the request. Start delivery
   repository/channel requests in parallel; stage ReleasePlans and RPAs need their tenant
   and channel inputs. Disk downloads also need the content set, Pulp and Content Gateway
   requests from [source evidence](source-evidence.md#10-production-identity-precedents).
4. **PM, in parallel:** Eng ID → SKU mapping, lifecycle page, support tier, bug and RFE routing.
